* biographs: Amino acid networks in Python

** What is biographs?
	 Other names for amino-acid network include:
	  * Protein contact network
		* Residue contact network
		* Structural protein network

		biographs is a python module converting structural files formats like *pdb* or
		*cif* into amino acid networks. It is written over the libraries =biopython and
		networkx. This allows for a flexible and powerful handling of both: protein
		networks and protein structures.
		
		An amino-acid network is a network of amino acids such that two amino acids are connected if
		they share two atoms within a certain distance. Here, this distance is defined by the keyword
		=cutoff= that defines the threshold distance in angstroms (Ã…).

		It uses the great Bio.PDB module to construct the network given
		a cutoff distance. Here, the network is a networkx.Graph object, which allows
		high customization of the network and tons of tools for networks analysis.

		To use biographs just type in a terminal:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/rodogi/biographs.git
cd biographs
#+end_src

** Basic usage


I have a =pdb= file in =/Users/rdora/1eei.pdb=, here is an example to build the amino acid network of
the cholera toxin (PDB id 1eei).

#+begin_src python
import biographs as bg


molecule = bg.Pmolecule('Users/rdora/1eei.pdb')
# biopython molecule structural model
mol_model = pmolecule.model
# networkx graph, by default 5 angstrom
network = molecule.network()
list(network.nodes)[:10]
# Output
['G26', 'G27', 'G24', 'G25', 'G22', 'G23', 'G20', 'G21', 'G28', 'G29']
#+end_src

*** Distance threshold and weight
		If you want to use a different distance to define if two atoms are connected or not (and
		therefore their amino acids), use:
		
#+begin_src python
# Threshold is 8 angstrom
network = molecule.network(cutoff=8)
#+end_src
		
		Similarly, if you want to set the network to be weighted, where each edge has a weight equal to
		the number of atom-pairs that are within the distance threshold, then:

#+begin_src python
network = molecule.network(cutoff=8, weight=True)
#+end_src

*** Water molecules
By default, water molecules are not considered as atoms, you can change that behavior with:

#+begin_src python
# Use water molecules
molecule = Pmolecule('/Users/rdora/1eei.pdb', water=True)
#+end_src

** Required packages

[[http://biopython.org/wiki/Biopython][biopython]]
Great to read and work with structure files such as pdb found in the protein
data bank. You can listen to the voices of three of the main contributors of
biopython in [[https://www.podcastinit.com/biopython-with-peter-cock-wibowo-andrarto-and-tiago-antao-episode-125/][this]] podcast.

[[https://networkx.github.io][networkx]]
Has an extensive set of functions to deal with networks.
